Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

-created enough base images for different traits in order to randomly produce 20 unique images.
-assigned even rarities among all the trait designs
-completed base code in javascript


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

-add 1-3 more images to each trait category to decrease chances of duplicates in creating 100
-mess with the rarity percentages in order to assign different rarities to certain trait qualities
-demo video

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

-problems I have encountered were mostly in getting used to javascript syntax and struggling to find errors since I was instinctively merging python syntax into my code without realizing.
-alligning the trait images properly so that no whitespace is shown in the completed image
