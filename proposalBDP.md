# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PNG Generator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

-A program that allows you to use PNGs from 5 categories(background, eye, face, hat, and head) to create 100 unique avatar-like images.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

-using javascript/visual studio code, the software will take one of many .png images from each of the 5 traits mentioned above and merge them in layers to a completed avatar-like image. The .png images will be created by me in adobe illustrator and I will be layerying them on top of one another in a specific order that will create the completed avatar. The features I add will be able to choose rarities for the images in each of the 5 traits by creating percentage values out of 100 for the images in each different trait. Another feature that will be added is to execute the output images multiple times to assure that no duplicates will be created. This feature can be done by producing 20 images at a time of 6 sets that way you are able to pick out any duplicates between the 120 of them giving the program some wiggle room for randomized error.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-A good outcome would be to create 20 unique avatar-like images

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-A better outcome would be to create 20 different avatar-like images with a clean output image where the merging layers dont underlap or overlap

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-The best outcome would be to create 100 completely unique and cleanly merged avatars where it is clear that you cannot find one image that is alike it in the set.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

-My next steps in assuring I can receive the BEST outcome for this project are mostly doing more research on how I can randomize the traits better. I could start researching by finding other programs that generate random outputs to figure out what I need to do in order to create a random value. I will need to further improve my skills in javascript to learn the proper formatting, vocab, and syntax in order to be able to run a javascript program correctly. I will need to learn to create image sets in illustrator and be able to properly align the pixel values with one another in the program to create images without overlapping layers. I will be working alone on this project and I plan on being able to experiment with the outputs in javascript to make sure my final product is a success.
